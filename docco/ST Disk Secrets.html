<h1>ST DISK SECRETS</h1>
<h2>Layout of tracks, sectors, files...</h2>
by Rick Oliver, Software Engineer, Hippopotamus Software

<p><i>Hippopotamus Software visited <b>Antic</b> not long ago to demonstrate their new line of ST software. Of particular interest to our programmers was <b>Hippo Disk Utilities</b>.
 This program – which is mouse-controlled and completely written under 
GEM – lets you examine and edit the tracks and sectors' of ST disks. You
 can also restore deleted files, find file information, or search and 
alter RAM (Look for a review of this product soon in the ST Section.) We
 asked Wendell Brown, president of Hippopotamus, if they would share 
with Antic readers some of the ST disk secrets they had discovered while
 developing Hippo Disk Utilities. The following is their very generous 
response. –</i> ANTIC ED

</p><p>Before discussing the ST disk operating system (ST DOS), it helps
 to know how the disk is physically laid out. For now we will limit the 
discussion to the single-sided, quad-density, 3.5-inch floppy-the type 
used in the Atari SF354 disk drive.

</p><h3>DISK STRUCTURE</h3>

<p>The disk is divided into 80 concentric circles called "tracks", which
 are numbered from zero at the outside to 79 near the center. Each track
 is divided into nine "sectors" numbered from one to nine, giving the 
disk a total of 720 sectors. And each sector can hold 512 bytes of 
information.

</p><p>Multiplying this out, we find a total raw storage capacity of 
360K on one floppy disk. But as we will see, not all of that space is 
available to the user for data storage.

</p><p>Since data on a disk is stored in files, not as tracks or 
sectors, ST DOS requires some disk space to chart which sectors belong 
to which files, what the names of the files are, and other file-related 
information.

</p><p>Some of this information is stored in the "directory," which 
occupies seven sectors of the disk. Another part is stored in the "File 
Allocation Table" (FAT), which is five sectors long.

</p><p>The FAT contains the information necessary to piece together 
files, and it is deemed important enough to have two copies stored on 
the disk. ST DOS also sets aside one sector on each disk, called the 
"boot record," which has information concerning the format of the disk 
plus a program to load the system at startup time.

</p><p>Adding it all up, we see that ST DOS uses up 18 sectors, or 9K, 
of raw disk space. All remaining space – the data space – is available 
for user file storage.

</p><h3>CLUSTERS</h3>

<p>If a file is written to a newly formatted disk, it will be stored in 
contiguous sectors. But usually a file is fragmented into different size
 groups and scattered around the disk to take best advantage of free 
disk space.

</p><p>The smallest unit of disk data recognized by ST DOS is called a "cluster". One cluster equals two contiguous sectors.

</p><p>Thus, the smallest size a file or file fragment can be is one 
cluster. And since each cluster consists of two 512-byte sectors, any 
file will use at least one kilobyte of disk space.

</p><h3>THE FAT</h3>

<p>The FAT – File Allocation Table – is used to keep track of which clusters belong to which files.

</p><p>The FAT takes up 5 sectors on the disk, but it is best to look at
 it as one long string of 12-bit table "entries." Since every byte is 8 
bits, this means that every 1 1/2 bytes of the FAT contain an entry.

</p><p>The first two entries of the FAT, numbered zero and one, identify
 the format of the disk. The first byte contains the identifying code 
($F7 for 80 track, quad-density), and the remaining two bytes are filled
 with $FF.

</p><p>Each following entry represents one cluster in the data space of 
the disk. The first cluster of the actual data space will be numbered 
two, so that it corresponds to the third FAT entry, also numbered two.

</p><p>Since each FAT entry is 12 bits, it can have a value from 0 to 
4095 ($FFF). If a FAT entry has a value of zero, its corresponding 
cluster is unused and therefore available to store new data. A value 
from 4081 to 4087 ($FF1 to $FF7) means the cluster is unusable because 
of a formatting error. Usually this means that at least one of the 
sectors in the cluster is physically bad, but it isn't a problem since 
ST DOS won't try to use that cluster.

</p><p>If a FAT entry has a value from 4088 to 4095 ($FF8 to $FFF), its 
corresponding cluster contains the end of a file. Any other value in a 
FAT entry (2 through 4080, or $FF0) indicates that its corresponding 
cluster is part of a file.

</p><p>The way ST DOS sees it, a file is actually a list of clusters in 
the data space. The first item in this list (the number of the first 
cluster of the file) is kept in the directory entry for that file. The 
corresponding FAT entry for the first cluster of the file contains the 
number of the second cluster. The FAT entry for the second cluster 
contains the number of the third cluster, and so on until a cluster is 
reached with a FAT entry between 4088 and 4095 ($FF8 and $FFF). This 
would be the last cluster of the file.

</p><p>So the clusters of a file may be anywhere in the disk's data 
space, and ST DOS just traces its way through the FAT entries to find 
all of the pieces.

</p><p>The important part of understanding how it works is in seeing 
that the data of a file is stored in clusters, that there is a 
one-to-one mapping between the clusters of a file and the entries in the
 FAT, and that each FAT entry shows where the NEXT cluster is found.

</p><h3>DESK DIRECTORY</h3>

<p>The disk directory is seven sectors long and contains all of the 
information about a file, except for the information stored in the FAT. 
Each entry in the directory is 32 bytes long and has eight fields:

</p><pre>			Directory Fields
		1)  Filename		 8 bytes
		2)  Filename extension	 3 bytes
		3)  Attributes		 1 byte
		4)  Reserved		10 bytes
		5)  Time of last change	 2 bytes
		6)  Date of last change	 2 bytes
		7)  First cluster	 2 bytes
		8)  File size		 4 bytes
</pre>

<p><b>Filename</b>–Contains the name of the file in ASCII text. There is
 a maximum of eight letters, all of which are stored in upper case. If 
the name is less than eight characters, the remainder of the field is 
filled with blanks. A zero in the first byte of the filename indicates 
that the directory entry has never been used. A value of 229 ($E5) in 
this byte indicates that the file has been erased. Finally, a period in 
the first byte of the filename indicates that the entry is actually a 
special type of subdirectory, as explained below.

</p><p><b>Filename Extension</b>–Contains three characters for the 
filename extension, stored in uppper case. If the extension has less 
than 3 characters, the remainder of the field is filled with blanks.

</p><p><b>File Attribute</b>–This field uses six of the bits in its byte
 to store certain file attributes (see ATTRIBUTES below). The other two 
bits are unused. 

</p><p><b>Reserved</b>–Currently unused and reserved for future use. All bytes in this field are normally set to zero.

</p><p><b>Time of Last Change</b>–This field is treated as a 16-bit 
value divided into three sections. The high five bits are used for the 
hour (0-23). The middle six bits are used for the minutes (0-59). The 
low five bits contain seconds in two-second increments (0-29). Multiply 
the seconds field by two to get the actual number of seconds.

</p><p><b>Date of Last Change</b>–Also treated as a 16-bit value which 
is divided into three parts. The high seven bits are used for the year 
minus 1980 (add 1980 to the year value to get the correct year). The 
next four bits are used for the month (1-12). The low five bits are used
 for the day of month (1-31).

</p><p><b>First Cluster</b>–Contains the number of the first cluster of 
the file. All following clusters in a file are found by tracing through 
the FAT, as explained above.

</p><p><b>File Size</b>–A four-byte (or 32-bit) number containing the 
size of the file in bytes. The effective size of a file, when read by ST
 DOS, may be shorter than this if the last cluster is reached in the FAT
 before this many bytes have been read.

</p><h3>ATTRIBUTES</h3>

<p>As mentioned, the third field of the directory is one byte, of which 
six bits are used as file attribute flags. Currently, many of these 
attributes seem to be ignored by ST DOS, but the meanings are given here
 in case they get used by future releases of TOS.

</p><pre>			   File Attributes
	Bit	Decimal Value	Hex Value	Meaning
	0	    1		   1		Read Only
	1	    2		   2		Hidden
	2	    4		   4		System
	3	    8		   8		Volume Label
	4	    16		   10		Subdirectory
	5	    32		   20		Archive
	6	    64		   40		Unused
	7	    128		   80		Unused
</pre>

<p><b>Read Only</b>–When set, will prevent a file from being deleted or written to. Will not prevent a file from being renamed, however.

</p><p><b>Hidden and System</b>–Have basically the same function. They 
should normally prevent the directory entry from appearing in a 
directory listing. These attributes are ignored by ST DOS and the 
Desktop.

</p><p><b>Volume Label</b>–Normally located only in the root directory 
of the directory structure. It marks a directory entry as containing the
 name of the volume or disk.

</p><p><b>Subdirectory</b>–Marks a directory entry as a subdirectory 
rather than a normal file. A subdirectory is the equivalent of a Desktop
 folder. Subdirectories are stored in the data space, just like files 
are. The structure of a subdirectory is the same as that of the main 
directory (usually called the root directory), except that a 
subdirectory is not fixed in size. A subdirectory only takes up as much 
space as it needs, but can grow to whatever size is necessary. There are
 two special entries in every directory which act as subdirectories 
themselves. They are "." and ".."–and they refer to the current 
directory and the parent directory, respectively The entry called ".." 
in the root directory refers to the root directory itself.

</p><p><b>Archive</b>–Normally used only with hard disks. It should be set if a file has changed since it was last backed up.

</p><h3>MULTIPLE FORMATS</h3>

<p>Until now, we have been assuming a disk format of quad-density, 
single-sided, 3.5-inch floppy. But ST DOS can actually support a wide 
variety of formats, in which the number of sides, tracks per side, 
sectors per track, and bytes per sector may vary. Formats may differ 
from drive to drive, or even between disks used in the same drive.

</p><p>The sides of a disk are numbered starting with zero. And disks 
are not limited to two sides. It is not uncommon for hard disks to have 
four sides – two platters with two sides each.

</p><p>Regardless of format, the boot record is located on the first 
sector of track zero, side zero. It is one sector in length and is 
usually followed immediately by the FAT, two copies of which are stored 
in most formats.

</p><p>The size of the FAT varies with the format of the disk. Directly 
after the FAT usually comes the directory, whose size also varies with 
disk format. Following the directory, and continuing to the end of the 
disk, is the data space which makes up the bulk of the disk.

</p><p>One other thing that varies with disk format is the size of the 
entries in the FAT. For floppies, they are commonly 12 bits wide. But 
hard disks usually have 16-bit FAT entries. Although these entries work 
in a similar fashion to the 12-bit entries, their values are slightly 
different.

</p><p>The first two 16-bit entries are still used to identify the disk 
format, And a FAT entry with the value zero still means that its cluster
 is unused and available. But the values for bad clusters on a hard disk
 become 65521-65527 ($FFF1-$FFF7), and the values for end-of-file become
 65528-65535 ($FFF8-$FFFF). Any value from 2 to 65520 ($FFF0) means the 
corresponding cluster is part of a file, and files are still built in 
the same way.

</p><h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Armed with a knowledge of the structure of a disk and a program to 
operate on that structure, it is usually possible to recover recently 
deleted files or to reconstruct most of a file if one of its sectors has
 gone bad.

</p><p>Programs such as Hippo Disk Utilities have functions which 
automatically recover deleted files, and features that allow direct 
editing of the entire disk.

</p><p>However, be careful if you venture into the realm of the disk 
doctor. It is always a good idea to perform any operations on a copy of 
your disk. That way, even if you destroy the clone, you won't lose the 
patient.
